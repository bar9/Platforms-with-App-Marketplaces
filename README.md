This is a list of software and platforms that have a marketplace for third party extensions & integrations. Use these platforms to discover and sell your next SaaS product, just like [Preetam Nath](https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/shopify-micro-saas) and [Tyler Tringas](https://tylertringas.com/micro-saas-ebook/) did.

Many of these platforms also have thriving markets for freelance developers and consultants that can help companies implement their own extensions for the platform. Use this list to find a software platform to specialise in for your freelance business.
